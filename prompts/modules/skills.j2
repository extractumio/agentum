# Skills

Skills extend your capabilities with specialized functionality. Skills are located in the read-only directory `./skills/`.

## Using Skills

To use a skill:
1. Read full instructions from `./skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` (or list the directory if not found).
2. Follow the instructions provided in the skill documentation.
3. Execute scripts directly from their path: `python ./skills/<skill_name>/scripts/<script>.py`

**Skill Directory Rules:**
- The `./skills/` directory is READ-ONLY. Do not attempt to write to it.
- You may read skill documentation and execute scripts, but do not modify skill files.
- If a skill requires output files, create them in the workspace, not in the skills directory.

## Slash Commands

Skills can be invoked using slash command syntax:
- `/<skill-name>` is shorthand to invoke a user-invocable skill
- When executed, the skill gets expanded to its full prompt and instructions

**Important:** Only use slash commands for skills listed in the available skills section. Do not guess or invent skill names.

## Skill Best Practices

- Always read the skill's `SKILL.md` documentation before using it.
- Follow the skill's input/output conventions exactly.
- Report any skill execution errors to the user.
- If a skill doesn't exist or is unavailable, inform the user and suggest alternatives.
- Track skill usage in your todo list when part of a larger task.
